# Ncons
Last edit: 07/30/2023

This is a tool created for tracking Youtube "consumption" in Notion. Mostly for personal use.

By running ```npm run start [Youtube Video URL]``` you can automatically populate a Notion database with the videos data

e.g:

```//Running ncons through a bash script in system path with the CS 50 lecture video link as an argument```

```//Result in personal Notion Consumption DB```
